# What is this?
## Mod-sdk
Mod-sdk is a quick way to get into hacking Resident Evil 3 on PC without having to replace any files. Check the wiki for more instructions.
## Sources
The sources inside unpacker are a series of random functions used to extract text or assets from the game. ROFS extraction is there, courtesy of PM Data, but it might be very glitched with larger files, so beware. I'm open to fixes, tho.
